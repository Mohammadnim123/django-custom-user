## OverView

Django does a great job at allowing to get started with a solid foundation. But a foundation is just the beginning. We still need to “build the house.”

One of the first things many developers need to do is have a custom user.

For this lab you’ll build your application from the very beginning with a Custom User model.

**Feature Tasks and Requirements**

create Django application from scratch that has a custom user model named CustomUser

Custom user should use email instead of username for signup / login

Application should work with Django Admin
